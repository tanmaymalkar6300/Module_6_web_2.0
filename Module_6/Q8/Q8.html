        <dd>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language for creating and designing web pages. It structures web content and ensures browsers display text, images, and other media correctly. HTML uses a series of elements, represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets to define the structure and layout of a webpage.

            
            HTML is often paired with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. Its simplicity and flexibility make HTML a fundamental technology for web development.</dd>
        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of web content. It allows you to apply styles like colors, fonts, spacing, and layout to HTML elements. CSS can be written inline within HTML tags, embedded within the HTML file inside a tag. It uses selectors to target elements and properties to define styles. CSS supports responsive design through media queries and flexbox/grid layouts. The cascade and inheritance principles determine how styles are applied when multiple rules affect an element.</dd>
        <dt>Javascript</dt>
        <dd>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for web development. It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces by manipulating HTML and CSS. JavaScript can run in browsers and on servers (via Node.js), making it essential for full-stack development. Key features include event handling, asynchronous programming (using promises and async/await), and support for object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming paradigms. With vast libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, JavaScript enhances web application development, providing a rich ecosystem for building modern, responsive, and scalable web solutions.</dd>
